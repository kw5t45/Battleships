# Battleships!
v.1

Battleships! is my first attempt at creating an object-oriented</br>
project.
Rules of Battleships! are created following official battleships'</br> 
rules https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/the-basic-rules-of-battleship-411069.

In this battleships game, you play against Bottard, a high-IQ bot</br> 
created by me.

A.I. of bottard:
At Battleships! version 1, bottard randomly bombs a location</br> on the map.

Run "main.py" to execute Battleships! and try to compete against Bottard</br>
in a 1v1 showdown. To choose your ship placements, input their edge</br>
notations and your ships (as long as the notations are valid) will appear</br>
on the map. Next to the map with your ships, appears the map which shows</br>
the notations you hit on the enemy map.


Special thanks to Konstantinos Daskalopoulos for helping me throughout </br>
this project.
